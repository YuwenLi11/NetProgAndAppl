1. make sure the system running the service "rpcbind", and prepare a file named "test.txt";
2. run "make" under the source code directory, it will generate two binary files: client & server;
3. run "client" and "server" in different directory;
4. running server: ./server/
5. running client: ./client localhost test.txt
6. check "test.txt" has been transferred to client_bin
# Team5 Lab4-Q1 Readme

## Purpose and Introduction
Write a complete connection-oriented client â€“ server program using RPC that performs the file server functionality using different file sizes: 900 and 1800 bytes. 

The client should record and display the exact number of bytes received.

## Files
This folder contains four files
* Makefile
* readme.md
* tcp_time_client.c
    * This file is the main purpose of this lab

## Compile
In command line, key in `make`.  One executable file `tcp_time_client` will be compiled and generated.
Use `make clean` to remove generated files.

## Execute
Type `./tcp_time_client [T_SERVER_IP_1] [T_SERVER_IP_2]` to send requests to two TIME server T_SERVER_IP_1 and T_SERVER_IP_2.

## Test case
We pick two arbitrary servers for this test case.
* 129.6.15.28
* 132.163.96.4

```
$ ./tcp_time_client 129.6.15.28 132.163.96.4
Send time request to 129.6.15.28...
TCP socket created
Connection established
Send time request to 132.163.96.4...
TCP socket created
Connection established
Receive from server 129.6.15.28: Mon Mar  5 20:41:30 2018
Receive from server 132.163.96.4: Mon Mar  5 20:41:31 2018
The difference between two servers are 1 seconds
```
