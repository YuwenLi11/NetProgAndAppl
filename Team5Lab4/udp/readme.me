# Team5 Lab4-Q2 Readme

## Purpose and Introduction
Write a complete connection-oriented client â€“ server program using RPC that performs the file server functionality using different file sizes: 900 and 1800 bytes. 

The client should record and display the exact number of bytes received.

## Files
This folder contains six files

* client_get_file.c
* get_file.x
* remote_procedure.c
* readme.md
* 1800.txt
* 900.txt

## Compile
Make sure the system running the service `rpcbind`

In command line, Type in `make`.  Two executable files `server` and  `client` will be compiled and generated

Please move `server`, `1800.txt`and `900.txt` into one directory

Please move `client` into another directory 

Use `make clean` to remove generated files

## Execute
First, type `./server` to run the UDP server in terminal 1

Second, type `./client ` plus `file name` to run the client in terminal 2

## Test case and expected result
test case1:
```
$ ./server       # server's terminal
$ ./client 900.txt   # client's terminal
```

test case2:
```
$./server     # server's terminal
$./client 1800.txt   # client's terminal
```
test case3:(no this file exist in server side)
```
$./server     # server's terminal
$./client anything   # client's terminal
```
check the file requested has been transferred to client's folder
